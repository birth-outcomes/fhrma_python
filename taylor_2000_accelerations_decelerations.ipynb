    "[Taylor et al. 2000](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-0528.2000.tb11112.x) - The development and validation of an algorithm for real-time computerised fetal heart rate monitoring in labour\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cleaning signals:** \"Both the fetal heart rate and uterine pressure signals contained artefact... Artefact must be removed prior to determining the timing of the decelerations; this is achieved by a low pass fourth order Butterworth filter with a cut off frequency of 0.02 Hz\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Identifying accelerations and decelerations:** \"Accelerations and decelerations were determined and classified according to definitions given by FIGO.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Not performed in FHRMA but also in paper:\n",
    "* **Classifying decelerations:** \"The classification of decelerations was based upon the temporal relationship between the minimum of the deceleration and the maximum of the associated uterine contraction. The uterine contractions were timed by means of an external tocograph. A late deceleration occurred where its minimum value was 20–60 s after the peak of a contraction\"\n",
    "* **Calculating FHR variability:** \"The fetal heart rate variability is calculated as twice the standard deviation of the fetal heart rate recorded continuously, after removing the accelerations and decelerations. Reduced variability is defined as one standard deviation < 5 beats per minute.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the description of the method for identifying accelerations and decelerations is not clear, and I have followed the interpretation of Boudet et al. below."
